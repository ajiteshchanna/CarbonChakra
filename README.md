## 🧠 What is Carbon Footprint?

A **carbon footprint** refers to the total amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs), mainly carbon dioxide (CO₂), released directly or indirectly through human activities.

It includes emissions from:

- Transportation  
- Electricity usage  
- Food consumption  
- Daily lifestyle choices  

Carbon footprint is measured in **CO₂ equivalents (CO₂e)** and helps quantify an individual’s or organization’s impact on climate change.

## 🌍 What are Carbon Emissions?

**Carbon emissions** specifically refer to the release of CO₂ and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere due to:

- Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas)  
- Industrial processes  
- Deforestation  
- Agriculture  

These emissions intensify the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming, rising sea levels, and extreme weather.

## ⚠️ Impact & Importance

Human-generated carbon emissions are the primary driver of climate change, causing:

- Increasing global temperatures  
- Ecosystem disruption  
- Floods and droughts  
- Loss of biodiversity  

Global initiatives such as the Paris Agreement aim to limit temperature rise below **1.5°C** by reducing emissions worldwide.
